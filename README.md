# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Making and training a Neural Networks model (using keras) to recognize handwritten digits.

Currently the model gives an accuracy of **98.18%** which can be improved upto **99.8%** using more complex *Convolutional Neural
Networks*(CNN). Right now I've used a really simple neural network since I've got to learn more about *CNN*s. So, I'll be improving 
this project in the near future.

#### Note

You'll still have to feed a 28 by 28 pixel image to this model since it's not a robust model and does very little pre-processing
on it's own. I hope to improve the model itself as well as the pre-processing in the future.
